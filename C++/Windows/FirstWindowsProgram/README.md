# FirstWindowsProgram

A basic windows program as documented in: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program <br>
This program does nothing more than open a new Window.

The StandaloneMain.cpp file achieves the same result as the other files without object-oriented programing.

## Visual Studio Project Options

To compile, set `"ProjectName" Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> System -> SubSystem` to `Windows`.
